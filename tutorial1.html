        <p>
            The sequence of statements to be executed is kept inside the curly braces { } known as the Loop body. After every execution of the loop body, condition is verified, and if it is found to be true the loop body is executed again. When the condition check
            returns false, the loop body is not executed, and execution breaks out of the loop.
            <br>FOR
            <br> - for loops are the most useful type. The syntax for a for loop is for ( variable initialization; condition; variable update ) { Code to execute while the condition is true } The variable initialization allows you to either declare a
            variable and give it a value or give a value to an already existing variable. Second, the condition tells the program that while the conditional expression is true the loop should continue to repeat itself. The variable update section is the
            easiest way for a for loop to handle changing of the variable. It is possible to do things like x++, x=x + 10, or even x=r andom ( 5 ), and if you really wanted to, you could call other functions that do nothing to the variable but still have
            a useful effect on the code. Notice that a semicolon separates each of these sections, that is important. Also note that every single one of the sections may be empty, though the semicolons still have to be there. If the condition is empty,
            it is evaluated as true and the loop will repeat until something else stops it. </p>
        <p>
            WHILE
            <br>- WHILE loops are very simple. The basic structure is while ( condition ) { Code to execute while the condition is true } The true represents a boolean expression which could be x==1 or while ( x !=7 ) (x does not equal 7). It can be any
            combination of boolean statements that are legal. Even, (while x==5 || v==7 ) which says execute the code while x equals five or while v equals 7. Notice that a while loop is like a stripped-down version of a for loop-- it has no initialization
            or update section. However, an empty condition is not legal for a while loop as it is with a for loop.
            <br> DO..WHILE
            <br>- DO..WHILE loops are useful for things that want to loop at least once. The structure is do { } while ( condition ); Notice that the condition is tested at the end of the block instead of the beginning, so the block will be executed at
            least once. If the condition is true, we jump back to the beginning of the block and execute it again. A do..while loop is almost the same as a while loop except that the loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once. A while loop says
            "Loop while the condition is true, and execute this block of code", a do..while loop says "Execute this block of code, and then continue to loop while the condition is true". </p>
        <p>
            Standard library functions
            <br> The standard library functions are built-in functions in C programming to handle tasks such as mathematical computations, I/O processing, string handling etc. These functions are defined in the header file. When you include the header
            file, these functions are available for use. For example: The printf() is a standard library function to send formatted output to the screen (display output on the screen). This function is defined in "stdio.h" header file. There are other
            numerous library functions defined under "stdio.h", such as scanf(), fprintf(), getchar() etc. Once you include "stdio.h" in your program, all these functions are available for use.
