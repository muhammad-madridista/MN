            A set is an unordered collection of different elements. A set can be written explicitly by listing its elements using set bracket. If the order of the elements is changed or any element of a set is repeated, it does not make any changes in the set.
            <br> Some Example of Sets
            <br> A set of all positive integers A set of all the planets in the solar system A set of all the states in India A set of all the lowercase letters of the alpha

            Representation of a Set Sets can be represented in two ways − Roster or Tabular Form Set Builder Notation Roster or Tabular Form The set is represented by listing all the elements comprising it. The elements are enclosed within braces and separated by
            commas.
            <br> Example 1
            <br> − Set of vowels in English alphabet, A={a,e,i,o,u}
            <br>Example 2
            <br> − Set of odd numbers less than 10, B={1,3,5,7,9} Set Builder Notation The set is defined by specifying a property that elements of the set have in common. The set is described as A={x:p(x)}
            <br>Example 1
            <br> − The set {a,e,i,o,u} is written as − A={x:x is a vowel in English alphabet}
            <br> Example 2
            <br>− The set {1,3,5,7,9} is written as − B={x:1≤x 10 and (x%2)≠0} If an element x is a member of any set S, it is denoted by x∈S and if an element y is not a member of set S, it is denoted by y∉S. Example − If S={1,1.2,1.7,2},1∈S but 1.5∉S
            Some Important Sets N − the set of all natural numbers={ 1,2,3,4,.....} Z − the set of all integers={ .....,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,.....} Z+ − the set of all positive integers Q − the set of all rational numbers R − the set of all real numbers W
            − the set of all whole numbers

            <br>Cardinality of a Set
            <br> Cardinality of a set S, denoted by |S|, is the number of elements of the set. The number is also referred as the cardinal number. If a set has an infinite number of elements, its cardinality is ∞. Example − |{1,4,3,5}|=4,|{1,2,3,4,5,…}|=∞
            If there are two sets X and Y, |X|=|Y| denotes two sets X and Y having same cardinality. It occurs when the number of elements in X is exactly equal to the number of elements in Y. In this case, there exists a bijective function ‘f’ from X
            to Y. |X|≤|Y| denotes that set X’s cardinality is less than or equal to set Y’s cardinality. It occurs when number of elements in X is less than or equal to that of Y. Here, there exists an injective function ‘f’ from X to Y. |X|

            <|Y| denotes that set X’s cardinality is less than set Y’s cardinality. It occurs when number of elements in X is less than that of Y. Here, the function ‘f’ from X to Y is injective function but not bijective. If |X|≤|Y| and |X|≥|Y| then |X|=|Y|. The
                sets X and Y are commonly referred as equivalent sets. </p>
