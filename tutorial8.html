            Probability can be conceptualized as finding the chance of occurrence of an event. Mathematically, it is the study of random processes and their outcomes. The laws of probability have a wide applicability in a variety of fields like genetics, weather
            forecasting, opinion polls, stock markets etc.

            <br>Basic Concepts
            <br> Probability theory was invented in the 17th century by two French mathematicians, Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, who were dealing with mathematical problems regarding of chance. Before proceeding to details of probability, let us
            get the concept of some definitions. Random Experiment − An experiment in which all possible outcomes are known and the exact output cannot be predicted in advance is called a random experiment. Tossing a fair coin is an example of random
            experiment. Sample Space − When we perform an experiment, then the set S of all possible outcomes is called the sample space. If we toss a coin, the sample space S={H,T} Event − Any subset of a sample space is called an event. After tossing
            a coin, getting Head on the top is an event. The word "probability" means the chance of occurrence of a particular event. The best we can say is how likely they are to happen, using the idea of probability. Probabilityofoccurenceofanevent=Totalnumberoffavourableoutcome/TotalnumberofOutcomes
            As the occurrence of any event varies between 0% and 100%, the probability varies between 0 and 1.

            <br>Steps to find the probability
            <br> Step 1 − Calculate all possible outcomes of the experiment. Step 2 − Calculate the number of favorable outcomes of the experiment. Step 3 − Apply the corresponding probability formula. Tossing a Coin If a coin is tossed, there are two
            possible outcomes − Heads (H) or Tails (T) So, Total number of outcomes = 2 Hence, the probability of getting a Head (H) on top is 1/2 and the probability of getting a Tails (T) on top is 1/2 Throwing a Dice When a dice is thrown, six possible
            outcomes can be on the top − 1,2,3,4,5,6. The probability of any one of the numbers is 1/6 The probability of getting even numbers is 3/6 = 1/2 The probability of getting odd numbers is 3/6 = 1/2 Taking Cards From a Deck From a deck of 52
            cards, if one card is picked find the probability of an ace being drawn and also find the probability of a diamond being drawn. Total number of possible outcomes − 52 Outcomes of being an ace − 4 Probability of being an ace = 4/52 = 1/13 Probability
            of being a diamond = 13/52 = 1/4
