            A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory;
            and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct
            because C is case-sensitive.
        </p>

            A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition
            has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program. A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the
            files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file,
            a function, or a block of code.

            There are five basic data types associated with variables: int - integer: a whole number. float - floating point value: ie a number with a fractional part. double - a double-precision floating point value. char - a single character. void - valueless special
            purpose type which we will examine closely in later sections. One of the confusing things about the C language is that the range of values and the amount of storage that each of these types takes is not defined. This is because in each case
            the 'natural' choice is made for each type of machine. You can call variables what you like, although it helps if you give them sensible names that give you a hint of what they're being used for - names like sum, total, average and so on.
            If you are translating a formula then use variable names that reflect the elements used in the formula. For example, 2(r (that should read as "2 pi r" but that depends upon how your browser has been set-up) would give local variables names
            of pi and r. Remember, C programmers tend to prefer short names!
