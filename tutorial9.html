            SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
            <br> Database Tables
            <br> A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data. SQL Statements Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done
            with SQL statements. The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table: Example SELECT * FROM Customers;

        </p>
        <p>
            <br>The SQL SELECT
            <br> Statement The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set. SELECT Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name; Here, column1, column2, ... are the
            field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax: SELECT * FROM table_name;
            <br>The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
            <br> The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values. SELECT DISTINCT Syntax
            SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;


        </p>
        <p>
            <br>The SQL WHERE
            <br> Clause The WHERE clause is used to filter records. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. WHERE Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
            <br>The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
            <br> The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators. The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition: The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE.
            The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE. The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE. AND Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2
            AND condition3 ...; OR Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...; NOT Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
        </p>
