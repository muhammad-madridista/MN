        <p>
            The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). Python was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively
            uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra "There should be one—and preferably only
            one—obvious way to do it", from "The Zen of Python". This mantra is deliberately opposed to the Perl and Ruby mantra, "there's more than one way to do it".


        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Keywords
            <br>Python has the following keywords or reserved words; they cannot be used as identifiers. and as assert async await break class continue def del elif else except exec False finally for from global if import in is lambda None nonlocal not
            or pass print raise return True try while with yield </p>
        <p>

            <br>Indentation
            <br> Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side rule). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block. In so-called
            "free-format" languages — that use the block structure derived from ALGOL — blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In most coding conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block,
            to visually set it apart from the surrounding code (prettyprinting). Consider a function, foo, which is passed a single parameter, x, and if the parameter is 0 will call bar and baz, otherwise it will call qux, passing x, and also call itself
            recursively, passing x-1 as the parameter.
