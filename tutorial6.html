            A proposition is a collection of declarative statements that has either a truth value "true” or a truth value "false". A propositional consists of propositional variables and connectives. We denote the propositional variables by capital letters (A, B,
            etc). The connectives connect the propositional variables. Some examples of Propositions are given below − "Man is Mortal", it returns truth value “TRUE” "12 + 9 = 3 – 2", it returns truth value “FALSE” The following is not a Proposition −
            "A is less than 2". It is because unless we give a specific value of A, we cannot say whether the statement is true or false.
            <br> Connectives
            <br> In propositional logic generally we use five connectives which are − OR (∨) AND (∧) Negation/ NOT (¬) Implication / if-then (→) If and only if (⇔).

        </p>
        <p>
            OR (∨) − The OR operation of two propositions A and B (written as A∨B) is true if at least any of the propositional variable A or B is true.
            <br>AND (∧) − The AND operation of two propositions A and B (written as A∧B) is true if both the propositional variable A and B is true.
            <br>Negation (¬) − The negation of a proposition A (written as ¬A) is false when A is true and is true when A is false.
            <br>Implication / if-then (→) − An implication A→B is the proposition “if A, then B”. It is false if A is true and B is false. The rest cases are true.
            <br>If and only if (⇔) − A⇔B is bi-conditional logical connective which is true when p and q are same, i.e. both are false or both are true.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Tautologies
            <br> A Tautology is a formula which is always true for every value of its propositional variables. Example − Prove [(A→B)∧A]→B is a tautology
            <br> Contradictions
            <br> A Contradiction is a formula which is always false for every value of its propositional variables. Example − Prove (A∨B)∧[(¬A)∧(¬B)] is a contradiction
